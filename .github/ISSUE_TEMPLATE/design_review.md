# Design Review

## Overview

Description: _Provide a brief overview of the feature or change. Explain its purpose, scope, and intended outcome._

Motivation: _Why is this feature or change needed? What problem does it solve or what improvement does it bring to Gkeyll?_

Impact: _Outline the expected impact on the codebase, including affected areas (e.g., /apps, /zero, Lua/G2 layer). Specify if there will be breaking changes or dependencies on other components._

## Proposed Design

Key Design Elements: _Describe the key aspects of your proposed design. Use clear, concise language to outline the algorithms, user-facing APIs, and architectural choices._

Interaction with Existing Code: _Explain how this change will integrate with the current codebase. Highlight any architectural or convention clashes, as well as areas that might require future refactoring._

Prototyping Efforts (if applicable): _Provide a link to your prototyping branch. Briefly summarize your findings from prototyping, including any adjustments made to the design._

Sample Code: _Include example input file fragments, unit tests, regression tests, or mock APIs. This will help reviewers understand how the proposed feature will be used and tested._

## Design Review Checklist

Approval Criteria: 

- Is the design coherent and consistent with Gkeyll's existing architecture?
- Does the design align with user-facing API standards?
- Are there functionality overlaps with existing features?
- Are the algorithms robust and appropriate for the intended purpose?

## Additional Notes

Future Considerations: _Are there any anticipated challenges or areas of concern in implementing this design?_

Feedback Integration Plan: _Outline how you will address feedback received during the design review process._
