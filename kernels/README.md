# Kernel Naming Convention

This folder contains the computational kernels generated by Maxima,
our computer algebra system of choice. 

The following naming convention has been adopted for the C kernels:
```
    equation_type_dimensionality_basis_polyOrder.c
```
so for example, the C kernel containing the volume update formula
for the Vlasov-Maxwell system in 2 configuration space dimensions and
2 velocity dimensions (2x2v), Serendipity basis, and polynomial order
2 would be:
```
    vlasov_vol_2x2v_ser_p2.c
```
while the C kernel containing all of the different surface
update formulas for each surface direction for the Vlasov equation
and that particular dimensionality, basis type, and polynomial order 
would be:
```
    vlasov_surf_2x2v_ser_p2.c
```

Within certain kernels, such as the surface kernels, the individual functions
are further modified to denote the specific update they are performing. Each
surface update function must specify what direction the surface update is in.
For example, the vx surface update within
```
    vlasov_surf_2x2v_ser_p2.c
```
has the function name
```
    vlasov_surfvx_2x2v_ser_p2(...)
```

Modifiers to the overall name should proceed the type (boundary_surf, surf, vol),
e.g.,
```
    vlasov_stream_vol_2x2v_ser_p2.c
```
or
```
    const_diffusion4_surf_2x_ser_p2.c
```
the former denoting the volume update formula for only the streaming term in 
the Vlasov equation in 2x2v, Serendipity basis, polynomial order 2 while the latter 
contains the surface update formulas for constant diffusion, fourth power (hyperdiffusion),
in 2D with the Serendipity basis and polynomial order 2.

# Header Naming Convention

Header files have the following naming convention:
```
    gkyl_equation_kernels.h
```
As an example, all of the C kernels for the Vlasov equation: volume, surface, and boundary
surface for the different Vlasov equation types (Vlasov-Maxwell, only streaming) are contained in:
```
    gkyl_vlasov_kernels.h
```

Further modifiers should follow the equation but before kernels.h. So the header file containing 
all of the declarations for the C kernels that contain the update formulas for computing 
velocity moments can be found in:
```
    gkyl_vlasov_mom_kernels.h
```
